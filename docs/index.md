# Salute - Scout District Administration System

Salute is a system to make the management and administration of a Scout District easier. It provides volunteers with digital tools that supplement existing systems and work well with local processes.

It's primarily a membership records system, allowing us to integrate volunteer data with other digital systems such as:

* Google Workspace
* Charity Commission
* scouts.org.uk
* and much more...

We have ambitions to utilise data to help run local scouting more efficiently, make volunteer's tasks easier, and identify challenges before they spiral into problems. A few such ideas are:

* Tracking volunteer turnover data
* Automating mailing list creation
* Enabling an excellent onboarding journey for new volunteers
* Ensuring we thank and offboard volunteers when they leave
* Managing group and section health
* Deprivation and demand mapping - integrating with waiting lists

## Project Status

We're still in the early stages of building Salute. We have a roadmap planned for an initial MVP, and beyond.

If you'd like to get involved, please contact the Southampton Scouts Digital Team: [digital@southamptoncityscouts.org.uk](mailto:digital@southamptoncityscouts.org.uk).

## Can I use this for my District or County?

We'd love to work with you to bring better digital tools to Scouts all across the country. We're currently aiming to build a system that works well for districts, rather than counties. We've tried to keep things generic where possible, but Salute is currently aimed to fit with our other digital tools (e.g Google Workspace instead of Microsoft 365). We'd welcome contributions to help make Salute work better for your area.
